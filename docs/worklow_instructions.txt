# Summary of the Development Workflow Process

# 1. Pull the latest changes from the `main` branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 2. Pull the latest changes from the `research` branch
git checkout research
git pull origin research

# 3. Decide which branch to work on:
# - Use `research` for experimental work
# - Use `main` for stable, production-ready changes

# 4. Optionally, create a new feature branch to isolate your work
# Uncomment and replace 'your-feature-name' to create a new feature branch
# git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# 5. Make your changes and thoroughly test them
# (Edit, add, or remove files as needed)

# 6. Add your changes to the staging area
git add .

# 7. Commit your changes with a meaningful message
git commit -m "Describe the feature or changes made"

# 8. Push your changes to the remote repository
# Replace 'feature/your-feature-name' with your branch name if you used one
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# 9. (Optional) Create a Pull Request on GitHub for code review

# 10. Merge your feature branch back into `research` or `main`
# Replace 'feature/your-feature-name' with your branch name if you used one
git checkout research  # or 'main'
git merge feature/your-feature-name

# 11. Clean up the feature branch after merging (if you used one)
# Replace 'feature/your-feature-name' with your branch name
git branch -d feature/your-feature-name

# 12. Push the merged branch to GitHub
# Replace 'research' with 'main' if you merged into main
git push origin research
